    <h2>A step-by-step walk through of your first HTML page</h2>
    <img src="https://ninjasfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/0000000000001491.png" />
    <p>
      HTML short for Hypertext Markup Language.Basically, it's the "code" behind
      every web page-even this one.If you are just beginning to learn HTML, let
      us tell you that it's a fairly easy task. HTML, without styling, can't do
      anything more than setting a layout, drawing a table, or creating
      frames-but it is handy has it helps you structure the content correctly,
      which is important when you sit down to add style to your HTML page.

    <p>
      However simple this might seem, it is a mighty useful tool when it comes
      to full fledged web development. Various tools easily eliminate the HTML
      coding from your work process-but if you want to be in full control of
      your webpage, you will need to have some command over HTML
    </p>
    <p>
      Through this article we aim to give you the essential HTML building blocks
      that will help you get up and running. Reading this will be able to
      understand in HTML source code and even modify for your own good!
    </p>
    <h2>Step One-Tags</h2>
    <img src="https://ninjasfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/0000000000001485.png" />
    <p>
      Tags are what you will see the most when you look at any HTML source code.
      A tag can ideally be seen as a wrapper to any item on your HTML document.
      Tags tell what magic is to be done on the content enclosed by them
    </p>
    <h4>Let's Look at the two types of tags:</h4>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>&lt;tag-example-1&gt;I need a closing tag.&lt;tag-example-1&gt;</li>
      <li>&lt;tag-example-2&gt;I don't need a closing tag.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      In the first example, the sentence is wrapped by two tags. The first one
      is called the opening tag and the second one is called the closing
      tag.Everything in between is affected by the properties of the tag. Very
      commonly used examples of such tags are &lt;html&gt;,
      &lt;head&gt;,&lt;body&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second example tags about loner tags- as in, they don't need a closing
      tag to function. Although it's not required ,these type of tags are
      written as <tag /> to make the debugging of the code easier. Commom
      examples of such tags are &lt;hr&gt;-used for horizontal line,&lt;br&gt;-
      to break the line,etc.
    </p>
    <h2>Step Two-HTML,HEAD,and BODY: the three pillars of the document</h2>
    <img src="https://ninjasfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/0000000000001488.jpg" />
    <h4>
      These tags are essential for any HTML document.They parcel out the
      significant parts of the HTMLcode.
    </h4>
    <ul type="disc">
      <li>
        &lt;BODY&gt; &lt;/BODY&gt; is placed below your &lt;HEAD&gt; &lt;/HEAD&gt;
        tag, and everything that you want to be displayed on the screen comes
        under this tag.Text,images,links and pretty much anyhting you can see in
        your browser live inside this tag.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        &lt;HTML&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt; wraps your entire code. Everything else in your
        HTML document need to be inside these tags.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        &lt;HEAD&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt; includes things like title, styles, and
        scripts. Head is usually present at the top (hah!) ,just inside the
        &lt;HTML&gt;tag.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Step Three-A few tags that'll make your page pretty</h3>
    <p>
      Now that you know how to set up the skeleton of your document, let's
      proceed with the things that will go inside your BODY tag and do some
      magic!
    </p>
    <p>Some basic text formatting tags are :</p>
    <ul>
      <li>&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt; makes your text look bold.</li>
      <li>&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt; make you write in cursive</li>
      <li>&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt; <u>underlines</u> what you just wrote.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For example, this piece of code.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>&lt;html&gt;</p>

    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;head&gt; &lt;/head&gt;</p>

    <p>&lt;body&gt;</p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;i&gt; Iam a italics &lt;/i&gt;
      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;b&gt; Iam a bold &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
      <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;u&gt; And me,well, I'm underlined!
      &lt;/u&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    </p>
    <p>&lt;/body&gt;</p>
    <p>&lt;/html&gt;</p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Should produce something like this on the browser. Don't fret too much
      about the <br />. It's just for breaking the line so that you can start
      from the next line. Enter key does little when it comes to changing lines
      in your HTML document.
    </p>

    <h3>Tags to help you structure your content:</h3>
    <ul type="disc">
      <b>
        <li>
          &lt;br/&gt; breaks the line, making you continue to the next line
        </li></b
      >
      <li>
        <b
          >&lt;p&gt; stands for paragraph. It divides your content into
          paragraphs.</b
        >
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <i
        >Note: You need to use these tags as spaces and enter jeys do very
        little when it somes to formatting content inside an HTML documen</i
      >
    </p>
    <h2>Heading tags :</h2>
    <p>
      HTML provides with six tags, from &lt;H1&gt;&lt;/H1&gt; to
      &lt;H6&gt;&lt;/H6&gt; to help you creat different sized headers quickly.
    </p>

    <img src="https://ninjasfiles.s3.amazonaws.com/0000000000001487.png" />
    <h3>Insterting an image:</h3>
  </p>All that's good, but what fun without images on thr webpages? Dont' worry <IMG/> to the rescue! The image tag has a mandatory attribute called "sorce". Basically, it tells the browser where it should look for the image. The syntax goes something like:</p>
 <p><i>&lt;img src="path_to_your image"/&gt;</i></p>  
 <p>
    Futhermore,it also has attributes like height and width that let you specify the height and width you want your image to take.  
</p>
<h2> Lists: </h2>
<p>HTML has two types of list- ordered and unordered. Each item of your list has to be enclosed in a tag. The syntax of creating a list is fairly simple.</p>
<p> Suppose you want to create a list like: </p>
 <ul>
    <li>Item 1 </li>
    <li>Item 2 </li>
    <li>Item 3 </li>
 </ul>
<p>The following code will easily do the job for you:</p>
<hr/>
<p>&lt;ul&gt;</p>  
</p>
 <p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;li&gt; Item 1&lt;/li&gt; <br/> 
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;li&gt; Item 1&lt;/li&gt; <br/> 
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;li&gt; Item 1&lt;/li&gt; <br/> 
 </p>
 <p>&lt;/ul&gt;</p>
 <hr/>
 <p> Write nothing </p>
 <p>This, by the way, was an example of an unordered list. For an order list, all you need to do is replace &lt;ul&gt; with &lt;oL&gt; and &lt;/ul&gt; with &lt;/ol&gt;.</p>
 </p>
 <p>Let's see what the following code does:</p>
 <hr/>

 <p> &lt;html&gt;</p>
    <p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;head&gt;  &lt;/head&gt;  
    </p>
    <p>
      &lt;body&gt;
    </p>
    <p> &lt;ul&gt;<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;li&gt; I am unordered list's item 1!&lt;/li&gt; <br/> 
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;li&gt; I am unordered list's item 2!&lt;/li&gt;  <br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;li&gt; I am unordered list's item 3!&lt;/li&gt;  <br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;li&gt; I am unordered list's item 4!&lt;/li&gt;  <br/>
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  </p>
  <p> &lt;ol&gt;<br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;li&gt; I am ordered list's item 1!&lt;/li&gt; <br/> 
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;li&gt; I am ordered list's item 2!&lt;/li&gt;  <br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;li&gt; I am ordered list's item 3!&lt;/li&gt;  <br/>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;li&gt; I am ordered list's item 4!&lt;/li&gt;  <br/>
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  </p>
  <p>&lt;/body&gt;</p>
  <p>&lt;/html&gt;</p>

  <p>All of these tags, when arranged coherently, will provide you with the simple webpage consisting of images, headings, and lists. Further, there are various tags that HTML supports, and we thoroughly recommended to check them out and play with them!</p>
  <h3>In Conclusion</h3>
  <p> You now know enough to skim through and understand any part of an HTML code. We request you to go ahead and try skimming through the source code of any website (you will find some tags you don't know, but that's how you learn!). Oh, and welcome to the word of web development. With HTML under your belt,your next top should be making your page look beautiful using CSS.</p>
  <P>Let us know if you had any problems in the article, and don't forget to have a look at a source code or two.</P>
